You can order repeat prescriptions online by filling out the form linked at the bottom of this page.

Before filling in a request, please read the information below regarding our legal obligation for prescription medication for your pets, based on new rules from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), which oversees vets in the UK.

## 1. Regular Health Checks

- To give out prescription-only meds (called POM-V), vets legally need to see your pet for a check-up every 6 months. There is one exception — parasite treatments (flea and worming treatments), which only need a check-up once a year.
- Sometimes, depending on your pet's health, we might need to see them more often.

## 2. Controlled Drugs

- These are tightly regulated and can only be prescribed for 1 month at a time.

## 3. Written Prescriptions

- We can provide written prescriptions at the vet's discretion, and there is a £20 charge per item for this (one item per written prescription).

## 4. RCVS Regulations

The RCVS has introduced new guidelines about prescribing certain meds — especially antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, and parasite treatments. This means your pet now needs to be examined in person every time we prescribe these types of meds.

- That includes things like ear or eye drops, and all prescription flea/worm/tick treatments.
- This change is all about making sure we are using antibiotics responsibly to help fight global antibiotic resistance.

## 5. Your Pet Will Need an In-Person Consultation If:

- We are prescribing meds for an ear or eye infection (since most contain antibiotics)
- We are giving antibiotics for skin issues — even long-term ones
- You are switching from one flea/worm/tick product to another
- We suspect a urinary tract infection (just doing a urine test is not enough anymore)
- We suspect a gut infection (stool tests alone are not enough now)
- You need a prescription flea/worm/tick treatment and your pet has not been seen in the last 12 months
