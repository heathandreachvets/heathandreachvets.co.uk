## How Long Do We Store Your Data

We review our data retention periods for personal information on a regular basis. We are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations. We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity (i.e. for as long as you are a client plus 7 years, or immediately if you request to be deleted), or for as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## Where We Store Your Personal Data

As part of the services we offer to you, the information which you provide to us is stored within our practice management system, Teleos Systems Ltd. Records will be available for the benefit of patient care and transferring records.

Your data may be transferred to countries outside the United Kingdom. This may happen if any of our service providers are located in a country outside of the UK. Where we transfer your information outside of the UK, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place as required by UK GDPR Article 46, such as standard contractual clauses or transfers to countries with a UK adequacy decision, to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Policy.

## Disclosure of Your Information

We will not sell or rent your information to third parties.

We will not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.

We may pass your information to our third-party service providers for the purposes of providing services to you (for example to send you appointment reminders). However, when we use third-party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.

We will not release your information to third parties unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime. We may also pass your information to our debt recovery service provider, should this be necessary to recover monies owed to us.

We may be required to share your personal data with your animal insurance company. We may also need to share your personal data with a veterinary referral centre or specialist should we need to refer your animal to them.

We use Vetstoria to provide online appointment booking. When you book online, Vetstoria processes your personal data on our behalf as a data processor. We have a data processing agreement in place with Vetstoria to ensure your data is handled securely and in accordance with UK data protection law.

## Links to Other Websites

Our website may contain links to other websites run by other organisations. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our website.

If you linked to our website from a third-party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of the operators of that third-party site and recommend that you check their policy.
